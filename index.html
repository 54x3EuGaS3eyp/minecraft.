                            which is very weird, like who in the world plays Minecraft at 7am!!! But on the other hand he is so considerate and never steals or cheats and, over all, a trustworthy companion. And his house looks more like a jungle than an actual house, and just don't enter his house if you want to keep all your arms and legs attached.
